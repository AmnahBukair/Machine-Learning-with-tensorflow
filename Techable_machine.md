# Teachable Machine
Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone. [Visit the web](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)

# Steps:  
### 1. Gather and group your examples into classes, or categories, that you want the computer to learn.  
it can be image from file, webcam, or even voice.  
here i upload brain images:

### 2. Train your model, then instantly test it out to see whether it can correctly classify new examples.
just press train:

### 3. Export your model for your projects: sites, apps, and more. You can download your model or host it online for free.

# Additional
Lets confuse the model with processed image that is mix between both heart and brain.

as you see the percentage below show how much confidence the machine is.
