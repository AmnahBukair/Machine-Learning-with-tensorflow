TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.  
### How to create the model?  
the easy way is to use Teachable Machine tool. [See the steps]()
